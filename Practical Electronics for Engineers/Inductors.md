- **Induced voltage(EMF)** is generated whenever there is a sudden change in current as follows:

### Self-Inductance

*Note*: Self-induction in the above example is so small that it has no measurable effect. This effect can be made significantly larger by introducing an inductor

### Inductors - Basics
- An inductor acts like a time-varying current-sensitive resistor, i.e. it is greatest during times of rapid increase in current
