*Note*: When connecting batteries in series, we increase the voltage, when connecting them in parallel we increase the current.

**Incorrectly Connecting Batteries in Parallel**

*Note*: In the above case, the currents almost cancel one another.


### Generating Voltage with Magnetic Fields
 **Law of Induction** - If a conductor is passed through a magnetic field or if a stationary conductor is placed in a changing magnetic field, a current is generated. (1)

*Note*: In the lower end, if we connect a power source that enables the shaft to rotate, we are able to convert motion to electricity.
