### Alternating Current

*Note*: It's a sine wave with a specific frequency

In this case(sine wave), the voltage peak-to-peak `V_pp` and the average voltage `RMS` are connected via the following formula:
```
RMS = 0.5 x V_pp/sqrt(2) = V_pp x 0.3535
```

For example, in case we get `120V` from a normal socket at home => the `V_pp` is `~340V` => The voltage alternates between `-170V` and `170V` 

### Converting AC to DC
- This is done via a **Full Bridge Rectifier**. It can capture:
	- the positive side

		- the negative side
