### Capacitor Impedance
![[Pasted image 20240118170104.png]]
It is denoted by $X_C$ and it is given by the following formula:
$$
X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi f C}
$$
*Note*: Above formula is valid only for AC current since the capacitor blocks the DC current and allows the AC current. $f$ is the frequency of the AC current.

*Note*: **Reactance(X)** conveys a component's resistance to AC while **Impedance(Z)** conveys its resistance to both AC and DC.

**Example**

Assume we have the following circuit:
![[Pasted image 20240118222058.png]]
First we find the **capacitive reactance** as follows:
$$
X_C = \frac{1}{2\pi fC} = \frac{1}{2 \times 10^{-4} \times 60 \times 3.14} = 26.5 \ohm
$$
Then to find the current we use the Ohm's law $I = \frac{V}{X_C} = \frac{10 V}{26.528 \ohm} = 0.377 A$
