- Used to step up/down voltages, i.e. stepping down the 120V AC from our wall outlet to 12V AC for the electronic device we are plugging in it.
- The AC current is then converted to DC via an adapter(using a Full-Bridge Rectifier)
- **Mutual inductance** - Two coils are wound together around a ferromagnetic core(i.e. iron).
- Voltage is then proportional to the number of coils:
```
V1/V2 = N1/N2
```
where `V1/V2` is the voltage on the primary/secondary side, `N1/N2` is the number of coils in the primary/secondary side.

- The above formula also implies the following:
```
I_2 = I_1 x (N1/N2)
```
