#Wireless
***

- WAPs provide connectivity between wireless stations or between the wireless and wired networks
- Wireless is half-duplex => only one device can communicate at a time
- **Distribution System(DS)** - Connects Wireless Access Points to the wired network

- **SSID** - A unique identifier that names the wireless network. A single AP can support different SSIDs, each with different security settings
- **Beacons** - Wireless Access Points broadcast information about their WLANs(including the SSID and authentication requirements) with beacon frames, but this can be disabled.
- **Extended Service Set** - The same SSID can be supported across multiple APs to give a larger coverage area => Wireless client stations can roam across Wireless APs supporting the same WLANs.
