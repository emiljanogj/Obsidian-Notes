Several connectivity options:

- **Fiber** - A very important technology here is **Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing(DWDM)**
	- **DWDM** - multiplexes multiple optical signals into one optical signal transmitted over a single fiber strand, where each signal is assigned a different wavelength => Many SP laid optical fiber in the past to find out they don't need it(Dark Fiber) because of DWDM.

#### MPLS

- Uses a shared core infrastructure at the service provider. It can be used for connectivity to the internet and/or connectivity bw offices over VPN.
- Traffic from multiple customers travels over the provider's shared MPLS network
- Different levels of SLA for uptime + traffic delay/loss available at different price points
- Ethernet connections used to the customer router
- Provide a full mesh topology by default
- Different customers ca be on the same subnet(no shared routing table)
