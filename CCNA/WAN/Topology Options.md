Several Topology Options:

- Hub and Spoke
![[Pasted image 20230520182417.png]]
Single point of failure. + suboptimal traffic flow as the traffic always needs to go through the hub(NY in the above image). Advantage is that we need to define a single centralised security policy.

- Redundant Hub and Spoke
![[Pasted image 20230520182533.png]]
Removes the single POF but higher costs.  Same advantages + disadvantages as the case above.

- Full Mesh
![[Pasted image 20230520182832.png]]
Optimal network traffic but at a higher cost and complexity.

- Partial Mesh
![[Pasted image 20230520183005.png]]
Combines Hub and Spoke with the Full Mesh.
