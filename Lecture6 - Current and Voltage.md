Assume we move the charge `q0` from `A(x1,y1,z1)` to `B(x2,y2,z2)`. Then, its potential energy will change.

*Note*: **Potential Energy Definition** - It's the energy things have because of their position.

Since the charge `q0` changed its position => its potential energy(**U**) will change. The voltage is the potential energy per unit charge , i.e.:
```
V = U/q0
```
and the change in voltage from point A to point B is given by:
```
dV=dU/q0
```

=> If we move `1 Coulomb` and expect `1 Joules` of energy, that's `1 V` => `1 V = 1 J / 1 C`

*Note*: The battery has an internal resistor which limits the amount of current we can draw.
