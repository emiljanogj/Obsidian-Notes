#EQ
***
- Equalization – or EQ – is one of the most well-known forms of audio processing in music production. With EQ, you can adjust the volume level of a frequency (or range of frequencies) within a sound, which in turn allows you to cure a sound – or sometimes even entire songs – of its imperfections. This is done by cutting unwanted frequencies and/or boosting others, all to balance out sounds so they work well with one another.

Each sound can be broken down into simple sine wave components. The basic components are called partials. If a partial is related to the fundamental frequency by a whole number => they're harmonic, otherwise they're inharmonic.
*Note*: When we use EQ, what we're basically doing is changing the frequency of a partial relative to the rest.

### Short Guide to Frequency Boosting

- **50-75 Hz**: Boost to beef up kick drums and sub bass lines. Cut to reduce excessive low-end weight
- **80 - 200 Hz**: Boost to add body to snares and guitars, punch to kick drums, roundness to bass, and general warmth. Cut to reduce low-end mud.
- **200 - 500 Hz**:  Boost to ‘warm up’ vocals, guitars and synths, and add presence to basses. Cut to reduce muddiness.
- **500 - 800 Hz**: Boost (with care!) to bring out the tone of almost any instrument. Cut to reduce ‘honk’.
- **2 - 5 kHz**: Boost to give vocals, guitars, synths and strings clarity, definition and impact. Cut to reduce harshness.
- **5 - 10 kHz**: Boost to add presence and sheen to drums, cymbals and guitars. Cut to reduce scratchiness and sibilance.
- **16 kHz+**: Boost for brightness and ‘air’. Cut to reduce high-end fizz.

*Note*: A good rule of thumbs when using Bell-curve shaped EQs is to use **narrow for cuts and wide for boosts**

### Mono vs Stereo

**Mono**
- Uses a single channel for all the instruments => no perception of width on the listener's end

**Stereo**
- Uses multiple channels, thus creating the perception of width

*Note*: When using **EQ** it is always better to mix in **Mono**

## EQ settings for electric guitar

With a foundational understanding of EQing electric guitars, let's dive into EQ settings tailored for different musical styles.

### Clean tones for pop or jazz

- Enhance the warmth by boosting around 80Hz (+2 to +4 dB).
    
- Apply a subtle boost at 800Hz (+1 to +3 dB) to enrich the tone.
    
- Introduce a bit of sparkle by adding a slight boost around 6kHz (+1 to +2 dB), enhancing the upper-end clarity.
    

### Classic rock distortion (70s and 80s style)

- Add depth to your sound with a light boost at 100Hz (+2 to +4 dB).
    
- Reduce some of the muddiness by cutting slightly at 400Hz (-2 to -3 dB).
    
- Accentuate the edginess and bite by boosting significantly around 3kHz (+3 to +6 dB).
    

### High-gain tones for metal

- For a robust low-end, moderately boost between 80Hz and 100Hz (+3 to +5 dB).
    
- Clear out muddiness and focus the sound by cutting in the 250Hz to 500Hz range (-3 to -5 dB).
    
- Increase the aggressiveness in rhythm parts with a boost around 3kHz (+3 to +5 dB).
    
- For lead sections, enhance sharpness and clarity with a substantial boost at 5kHz (+4 to +6 dB).
    

These settings offer a starting point for shaping your guitar tone in various genres. Remember, the best EQ settings depend on your specific guitar, amp, and the overall mix of the track.
