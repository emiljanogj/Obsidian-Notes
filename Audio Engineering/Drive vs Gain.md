- **Drive (or input)** usually adjusts the signal level being introduced to an amplifier. More drive will push the signal closer to the overload region of the amp, introducing more distortion artefacts.
- **Gain** is the actual gain of the amplifier, usually controlled by reducing the negative feedback around the amp. Lower negative feedback not only increases the gain, but also reduces the amp's linearity, introducing other forms of distortion. In many cases, it will also affect the frequency response too, softening the high end, particularly.

#### High Gain Amps
- Come with less headroom => the sine wave gets clipped much quicker as we add gain => more distortion

#### Conclusion

- **Gain** works on the pre-amp stage while **Drive** works on the amp stage

*Important Note*: When we drive the signal to the point where it exceeds the amplifier’s output ceiling, we get a distorted sound, or, in other words, we get an overdriven sound.


**Breakup** - Gain point where the amp starts distorting
